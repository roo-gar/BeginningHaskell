--- A ---
	• a polymorphic type is written with its name along with a list of all its type parameters

--- B ---
	• ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
	• ($) apply a function to its arguments
	• Haskell gives a very low precedence to ($); therefore, we can omit a lot of parenthesis when using ($)
	• e.g. maximum (map succ [1, 2, 3]) is equal to maximum $ map succ [1, 2, 3]

--- C --- 
	Anonymous functions are function bodies that are not given a name and that can be written anywhere in the code where a function is expected. 
	The function body syntax is: \param1 param2 ... -> body
	(e.g. map ( \x -> x + 2 ) [1,2,3])
	• a section is just a specification of the operation to be done, enclosed in parenthesis, and where the parameters for the anonymous function are completely wiped out. (e.g. map (/2) [1,2,3])
	• if a keyword appears in the end of both parameters lists (e.g. double list = map (\x -> x * 2) list) it can be omitted double = map (\x -> x * 2)

--- D ---
	Partial application encourages a programming style where functions are combined without ever mentioning their parameters which is called point-free style
	• the most important of these combinators is the period (.), which composes two functions (f . g = \x -> f (g x))
	• combinators are functions that create a point-free style by combining other functions (e.g. curry and uncurry)

--- E ---
	• module imports are listed after the module declaration, but before any other definition
	• you can specify that you wish to import only some functions (e.g. import Data.List ( permutations, subsequence ))
	• you can specify that you wish to import everything except functions (e.g. import Data.List hiding ( head, tail ))
	• to import or hide a data type extra syntax is required
	(e.g.	import Chapter3.ParamPoly ( Client() )                    	-- only type, no constructors
			import Chapter3.ParamPoly ( Client(GovOrg,Individual) )     -- a subset of constructors
			import Chapter3.ParamPoly ( Client(..) )   					-- .. is used for importing all constructors)
	• a qualified import requires you to prefix a function with the name of the module it came from (e.g. import qualified Data.List (permutations, subsequence))
	• you can rename the module using as (e.g. import qualified Data.List as L)
	• you can control which declarations you want to export (e.g. module M (f) where ... will only export function f)

--- F ---
	A fold over a data structure such as a list is a function that aggregates or combines all the values contained in that structure to produce a single result.
