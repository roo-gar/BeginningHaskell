C. Anonymous functions

--- A ---
	• a polymorphic type is written with its name along with a list of all its type parameters

--- B ---
	• ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
	• ($) apply a function to its arguments
	• Haskell gives a very low precedence to ($); therefore, we can omit a lot of parenthesis when using ($)
	• e.g. maximum (map succ [1, 2, 3]) is equal to maximum $ map succ [1, 2, 3]

--- C --- 
	Anonymous functions are function bodies that are not given a name and that can be written anywhere in the code where a function is expected. 
	The function body syntax is: \param1 param2 ... -> body
	(e.g. map ( \x -> x + 2 ) [1,2,3])
