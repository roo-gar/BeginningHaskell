--- A ---
The type of an expression e can be obained by entering :type e or by entering :t e
• v :: T means that v is a value in the type T (e.g. False :: Bool)
• e :: T means that the expression e will produce a value of type T (e.g. not True :: Bool)

Basic Data Types

I. Char
	• Can be written in three different ways: 'a', \97', or '\x61'
	• Extra functionality is provided by Data.Char module

II. Num
	Can be one of the following types:
	1. Int: bounded integer type with range -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
	2. Integer: the unbounded integer type which can support any decimal value
	3. Fractional: 
		Can be one of the following types: 
		3.1. Float: single precission floating-point number
		3.2. Double: double precission floating-point number
		3.3. Ratio: rational number (e.g. 1 % 2) 
			* Data.Ratio module must be imported

III. [Char] a.k.a. string
	• Written between double quotes (e.g. "Hello")

IV. [τ] a.k.a. lists
	• Lists are homogeneus
	• Lists are linked lists
	• Basic list operations:
		a) cons: append an element to the end of the list
			(:) :: a -> [a] -> [a] 
			> 1 : 2 : 3 : []
			> [1,2,3]
		b) null: check wehter the list is empty
			null :: Foldable t => t a -> Bool
			> null []
			> True
		c) head: get the first element of the list
			head :: [a] -> a
			> head [1, 2]
			> 1
		d) tail: get the list without the first element
			tail :: [a] -> [a]
			> tail [1,2,3]
			> [2,3]
		e) concat: concatenate one list with another
			(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
			> [1,2] ++ [3,3]
			> [1,2,3,3]

V. Bool
	• True or False values
	• Support long-circuiting (& and |) and short-circuiting (&&, || and not)

VI. (a, b), (a, b, c), ... a.k.a. tuple
	• Tuples can be heterogeneus	 
	• A pair is a tuple with two elements that supports the following operations
		a) fst: get the first element of the pair
			fst :: (a, b) -> a
			> fst (1, 2)
			> 1
		b) snd: get the second element of the pair
			snd :: (a, b) -> b
			> snd (1, 2)
			> 2

--- C ---
	if <b> then <t> else <f> expression must fulffill the next requirements
	• t and f must be expression themselves
    • both then and else branches must be present along with the if
    • the entire expression must have a defined type
    (e.g. if 3 < 4.5 then "3 is less than 4.5" else "3 is not less than 4.5")

--- D ---
	There are two kinds of bindings:
	1. let: introduces the binding before the main expression
		• let <name> = <expression> in <main expression...>
	2. where: introduces the binding after the main expression
		• <main expression...> where <name> = <expression>
